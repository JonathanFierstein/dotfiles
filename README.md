# Dotfiles

### Introduction
While this repo has the title "Dotfiles," it containes a much wider variety
 of text based configuration file examples beyond just dotfiles for systems
 that run Linux and also Windows.

Any sort of configuration file where someone might wish for an example version
to help demonstrate the configuration options and the file format would be a good candidate
for this repository (when I get around to adding such an example :)).   The only time I will
exclude such files is when the blanking or clearing of security sensative information 
(Such as passwords or usernames etc would make undersanding the sample configuration file 
very difficult.  In this situation, if changing actual data to fake data (Password 
= "Passw0rd" instead of the real password) resolves the problem, I will do that instead.
